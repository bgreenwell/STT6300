# Binding potentials measured from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans on 
# depressed and normal control subjects in the hippocampus region of the brain. 
# The binding potential is a measure how well serotonin binds to serotonin 
# transporters. It is believed that depressed subjects will have a lower binding 
# potential.

# Measurements from normal/control group
