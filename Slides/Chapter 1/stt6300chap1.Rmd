## About me

* B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in Applied Statistics
* Worked in the WSU SCC for a tear
* Spent the last two as the lead Data Scientist over at the School of Aerospace Medicine
* Currently work in the Data Science Lab at AFIT


# What is statistics?


## Statistics

* The science of data collection and analysis!
* The sexier term is now *Data Science*

## Design

Before analyzing the data, the data needs to be collected. Thus, statistics also encompasses the science of collecting data.

* **Sampling design** is the branch of statistics that focuses on collecting observational data
* **Experimental design** is the branch of statistics that focuses on collecting data through experiments, like in a laboratory



## Biostatistics

* Statistics applied to biological experiments, especially in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and fishery
* Has seen enormous growth in recent years
* Use in high-throughput data
* New biomedical technologies like **microarrays**, next generation **sequencers** (genomics) and **mass spectrometry** (proteomics) generate massive amounts of data
* Surge in new statistical methodology to dea with these "massive" data sets
* Thousands of statsitical tests performed (false discvery rates)


## How many observations should one collect?

* Statistical power
* Effect size
* etc.


## Statistical software

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)


## Populations and samples

## Statistical models

The scientific question that one hopes to investigate using statistical analysis can usually be formalized using statistical models. We shall use the following example to illustrate a simple models.

```{r}
data(Animals, package = "MASS")  # brain and body weights for 28 species of land
head(Animals)                    # animals
```


## Statistical models

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # setup to place the following plots side-by-side
plot(Animals)  # plot the first column (x-axis) vs. the second column (y-axis)
plot(Animals, log = "xy")  # transform both variables by taking the natural log
```


## Statistical models

```{r}
slr <- lm(log(brain) ~ log(body), data = Animals)
plot(Animals, log = "xy")  # transform both variables by taking the natural log
abline(slr, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```


## Statistic

A statistic is a number that is computed from the data in a sample. That is, a statistic is
computed by plugging numbers (i.e. the data) into a formula that does not require knowing the true
parameter values of the population. One of the simplest examples of a statistic is to simply average the
data values to compute the mean.
