## Chapter 4.

1. No (it looks bimodal).
2. The best answer is (d); bimodal.
3. The population might consist of both males and females, and each of these subpopulations probably has its own mean.
4. The best answer is (a); 31.
5. The best answer is (c); 0.22.
6. The best answer is (e); 0.94.
7. It will remain the same.
8. The best answer is (d); 0.27.
9. The best answer is (d); 0.58.
10. $X \sim N\left(\mu = 5.28, \sigma = 0.4\right)$

    10a. 
  $$
  P\left(X > 5.4\right) = 1 - P\left(X \le 5.4 \right) = 1 - P\left(Z < \frac{5.4 - 5.28}{0.4}\right) = 1 - P\left(Z < 0.3\right) = 1 - \Phi\left(0.3\right)
  $$
In R, we get
```{r}
1 - pnorm(0.3)
```
